### Key Changes
1. **In-Memory Data Structure**:
   - Replaced the SQLite database with a `self.audios` list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains `name`, `file_path`, and `description`.
   - Audio metadata is stored in memory and persists only during the application session.
   - Removed all references to `database_manager.py` and SQLite.

2. **Data Operations**:
   - **Save**: Adds new audio entries to `self.audios` when saving recorded or uploaded audio.
   - **Edit**: Updates the UI fields with the selected audio's metadata (full editing can be extended later).
   - **Delete**: Removes the audio from `self.audios` and deletes the file from the `data` folder, then refreshes the UI.
   - **View Properties**: Displays the audio's metadata from `self.audios` in a message box.

3. **File Handling**:
   - Audio files are still saved to the `data` folder (`.wav` for recordings, original format for uploads).
   - Uploads copy files to the `data` folder with the provided name.
   - Simulated audios are only loaded if their files exist in the `data` folder.

4. **UI and Functionality**:
   - Retained all previous improvements: recording with `sounddevice`, playback with `pygame.mixer`, file upload with `tkinter.filedialog`, level meter, and timer.
   - Fixed minor bugs in the context menu and button grid placement.
   - Adjusted error handling to account for file operations without a database.

5. **Pyodide Compatibility**:
   - Ensured `pygame.mixer` usage avoids unsupported file I/O or network calls.
   - Audio files are saved as `.wav` for recordings to ensure compatibility with `soundfile` and `pygame`.

### Installation Requirements
Update your `requirements.txt` to include:
```text
customtkinter
sounddevice
soundfile
pygame
numpy
```

### How to Test
1. Replace your `audioView.py` with the provided version.
2. Remove any references to `database_manager.py` (no longer needed).
3. Ensure the `data` folder exists or is created automatically.
4. Install the required libraries.
5. Run `main.py` and test:
   - **Recording**: Click "Grabar," speak, stop, name the audio, and save.
   - **Upload**: Click "Subir Audio," select a `.wav` or `.mp3` file, name it, and save.
   - **Playback**: Click the play button on any audio in the console.
   - **Manage**: Right-click audio buttons to edit, delete, or view properties.

### Limitations
- **Data Persistence**: Since data is stored in memory, audio metadata is lost when the application closes. To persist metadata without a database, you could save `self.audios` to a JSON file on exit and load it on startup (let me know if you want this added).
- **Simulated Audios**: Only load if the files exist in the `data` folder. For testing, create dummy `.wav` or `.mp3` files in `data` matching the simulated paths.
- **Editing**: The `edit_audio` method populates the UI fields but doesn't update the audio yet. You can extend it to modify `self.audios` and refresh the UI.

Let me know if you want to add JSON persistence, enhance the editing functionality, or implement the video view next!
